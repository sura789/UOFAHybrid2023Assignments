Predicting Loan Defaulters: A German Bank Case Study

Introduction:

This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to predict potential loan defaulters using historical data from a German bank. By analyzing various customer attributes and behaviors, we seek to provide the bank with actionable insights to mitigate risks and optimize operations.
